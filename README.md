# Robust Saliency Detection Algorithm via Multi-Level Graph Structure and Accurate Background Queries Selection

This is a matlab implemention of the saliency detection algorithm proposed in the [paper](https://github.com/Flocculus/Saliency-Detection-Algorithm-via-Multi-Level-Graph-Structure-and-Accurate-Background-Queries-Select/blob/master/Robust%20Saliency%20Detection%20Algorithm%20via%20Multi-Level%20Graph%20Structure%20and%20Accurate%20Background%20Queries%20Selection.pdf).

## Usage

Run main.m file to compare the result between my algorithm and the result from this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7298887)
